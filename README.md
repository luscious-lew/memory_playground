# Memory Playground 🕹️📰

**Hackathon project for the GPT-5 Startup Hackathon NYC**  
Omi wearable + GPT-5 = your personal memory, remixed into playful daily artifacts.  

---

## ✨ What It Does
Memory Playground taps into **messages + Omi voice recordings** and transforms them into fun, interactive formats using GPT-5:

- 📰 **Daily Newspaper** – get your life as front-page news (headlines, market report, advice column, comics).  
- 😂 **Roast My Week** – GPT-5 humorously critiques your habits.  
- 🎲 **Context Trivia** – play Jeopardy with your own conversations.  
- 🎭 **Comic Generator** – turn chat threads into stick-figure panels.  
- 🔮 **Future You** – advice from your future self.  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Capture**: Messages + Omi wearable voice notes feed into the system.  
2. **Process**: Transcripts and snippets are parsed into structured events.  
3. **Remix**: GPT-5 applies style transfers (news, roast, trivia, etc.).  
4. **Present**: A splashy desktop dashboard displays playful outputs live.

## 🚀 Demo
During the hackathon demo, we’ll show:
- Recording a thought on the **Omi wearable**.  
- Watching it instantly appear in a **newspaper front page**.  
- Switching to **Trivia mode** where judges can play.  
- Ending with a **roast** of the day.
